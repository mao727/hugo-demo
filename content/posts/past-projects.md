### Predict Stock Movement Based On News Headlines (team of 4)
#### Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States, 2022
- Collected data on global stock market and news headlines.
- Applied NLP techniques to news headlines and performed sentimental analysis.
- Implemented and trained multiple machine learning models.

### COVID Impact on the US Stock Market (team of 3)
#### Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States, 2021
<https://github.com/tc457/COVID_US_Economy>
- Collected data on the US stock market and COVID to analyze the impact of COVID’s factors on each of the 11 main S&P sectors. Conducted feature engineering and feature generation.
- Implemented and trained multiple linear models including Ridge and Lasso and tree-based models including Random Forest with moving average in Python to identify the most important features for each sector. Selected Random Forest for future prediction.


### Time Series Analysis on Global Mean Ocean Temperature
#### University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2021
- Implemented an ARIMA model in R consisting of a zero-mean lagged relationship and a non-stationary trend to analyze global mean ocean temperature changes from 1880 to 2017.
- Forecasted the future ten years' global mean temperature and created a detailed 10-page report.

### Students’ Correctness Prediction (team of 3)
#### University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2020
- Predicted the correctness of students' answers to as-yet-unseen diagnostic questions to estimate the student's ability level in a personalized education platform.
- Implemented models in Python using KNN, IRT, and NN algorithms. Evaluated model performance among the algorithms used, and selected NN as the base model. Applied ensemble and regularization terms to improve model accuracy and efficiency.
